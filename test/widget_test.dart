// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.
/*
Here we are gonna test the buisiness logic for our game. this game has a similar flavor as the android unlock pattern. 
The difference is that we are gonna draw lines between the dots. and when four lines together form a square, the player gets score.

In the test directory  we are gonna implement all the buisiness logic and then we are gonna test it.
